## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

As stated in [Getting Started](#getting_started), this project was only tested on Linux, LMDE 5, Debian 10, so built-in tools may not be available on other systems. Please create an issue if you have any problems.
Other than that, you'll need to install the following dependencies (you'll find step-by-step instructions for the Python packages in the [Installing](#installing) section below):
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager) <-- I used debian's package manager to install this
- Python packages:
  - sqlalchemy
  - pandas
  - numpy
- MySQL server (version 8.0.23) <-- I used debian's package manager to install this
- MySQL Workbench (version 8.0.23) <-- I used debian's package manager to install this

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to install the dependencies. The following instructions will install the dependencies in a virtual environment.
You should also have a MySQL server running on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/). Instructions for setting up a MySQL server can be found [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-getting-started/en/).
